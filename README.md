# Description

The creation of this web app is inspired by the wildly popular website Zillow.com where users can browse property listing, connect with an agent, explore mortgage options, and more. It is built with Sinatra, ActiveRecord Unit, with other assistive gems.

Some of the key features the property marketplace app provide are:

A user can:
	=> Sign-up for a new account
	=> Sign-up as a buyer or seller
	=> Log-in to their account
	=> Update their profile and/or change password
    => Delete their account
	=> See a list of buyers, sellers, and properties

As a buyer, a user can:
	=> View all properties
	=> Request an offer
	=> Review offers’ status (pending, accepted, or declined)
	=> Update or delete existing offers

4. As a seller, a user can:
	=> View all properties
	=> List a new property
	=> Update or delete their own properties
	=> See and/or update buyers’ offers
